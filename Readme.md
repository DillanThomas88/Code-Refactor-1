# <Code-Refactor-01>

## Description
This project was a simple yet fun introduction into semantic resposibities within html and css files as well as an introduction to Accebility(The proper way to make webpages accessable to those who may be disabled). I'm happy with the outcome of this project not only becasue it looks good and is read-friendly but becasue i learned so much about the fundamentals of writing proper html and css at a beginner level.
